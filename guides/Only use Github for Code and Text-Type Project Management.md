## Recommended repo type: Text-first / Code repo (best Github experience)

Uses: Code, README.md, docs, notes, checklists, copy, CSV, JSON, small images
Benefits: clean diffs, easy PR review.

### B) Design/binary-heavy repo (not recommended)

It's best to avoid large binaries in GitHub for the fllowing reasons.:

- PSD / AI / INDD / AE / PR projects, big images, video
  Reality: GitHub won’t show meaningful diffs for these—just “file changed”.

**Best practice for design repos**

- Do not store **source files** (INDD/PSD), instead export **review-friendly outputs** (PDF/JPG/PNG) so PRs are reviewable.
- Max file size (on normal gihub, not paid Large-File_System) version is 100Mb so I avoid putting large binaries on GitHub.
